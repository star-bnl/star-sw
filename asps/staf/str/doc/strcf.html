/*  Description:     Convert a C-defined text-string into a FORTRAN-suitable string.

	Take a text-string, defined in a C routine and to be passed into
a FORTRAN routine, and copy it into a text-string defined in that C routine.
All characters in the text for the FORTRAN routine from the null to the
end of ftext are replaced with blanks.
