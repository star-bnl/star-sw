/*

  FORTRAN callable:

	LOGICAL STRBYTE_OPENW, Success

	Success = STRBYTE_OPENW( Filename )

*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) Filename !ASCII name of file to be openned as a new file, to be written to.
	                       !It is not necessary for the FORTRAN caller to worry about null-
	                       !terminators;  a null is appended to a local copy of "Filename"
	                       !before being passed to any "ANSI C Routines", or any other "C"
	                       !routines.  This is supposed to be a friendly interface to FORTRAN.


  Inputs:
