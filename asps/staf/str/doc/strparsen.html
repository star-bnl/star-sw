<pre><h3>LOGICAL FUNCTION STRPARSEN(S,SPT,D)</h3>


*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) S !Character string containing one or more "arguments"
*                        separated from one another by "separators".

*  Input/Output:
	INTEGER SPT     !Index to a starting point in S, advanced to the next
*                        starting point after each call to STRPARSEN.

*  Output:
	CHARACTER*(*) D !Returned with the single argument from S, indexed by
*                        SPT upon the call to STRPARSEN.

*  Return values:
*	Return .TRUE. if a next (now, this) argument exists, .FALSE. otherwise.

*  Description:
*	Parse the next argument out of S and into D.
*	Leave SPT pointing at the space after the argument parsed,
*	or at SMAX.  Call STRPARSEN in a loop until it returns false,
*	giving it a different D each time (D is usually a dimensioned
*	array);  this parses out the arguments in S.  Separators are:
*	space, tab, comma, and equal-sign.  The equal-sign is a special
*	separator in that it is also returned as an argument.  This permits
*	checking externally to STRPARSEN that equal signs occur where they
*	are supposed to.  To keep spaces or "=" in a single argument, embed
*	the whole argument in double quotes "".
