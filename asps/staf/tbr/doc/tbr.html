<h2> Introduction </h2>
The table browser lets you look at tables conveniently.  It has a cuts
mechanism so that you can make complicated row selections, eg,
<pre>
  ((id.gt.1000.and.id.lt.2000).and.inpt.gt.5).or.(npt.lt.30)
</pre>
It is a GUI program that uses the mouse for everything except
typing cuts strings and hard row ranges (eg, rows 2001 to 3000).
It is the simplest way currently available to look at dynamic tables.
It make simple histograms.  Its design is modularized, so that, eg,
you can apply cuts while making histograms.
It runs both<ul>
<li>inside of STAF
<li>at the UNIX prompt (.xdf files)
</ul>

<h2>To run inside of STAF</h2>
The table browser is available in STAF.
To add it to your STAF executable,
uncomment the MOTIF:= line in your bin/Makefile,
and add tbr at the beginning of LHS of the the ASPS line in
your Makefile.control.
After you have the STAF prompt, to bring up the browser type
<pre>                  tbr/motif/viewdataset
</pre>

<h2>To run at the UNIX prompt</h2>
From the UNIX prompt type (if tbr is not in your PATH, contact
starlib@bnl.gov)
<pre>        tbr myfile.xdf</pre>
You can generate <code>.xdf</code> files from STAF tables by
typing, for example,
<pre>        data_io/write myfile.xdf xdf table1 table2</pre>
