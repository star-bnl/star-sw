/*  Description:  Set the abort limit for the message recognized by Prefix.
	Program termination results when the prefix's
	count has exceeded Limit.  Wildcards are permitted.
	The existing count-limit (after which message-display is disabled
	for Prefix), is set to the same value -- aborting msg calls
	should not be quiet without deliberate intervention (ie, re-specify
	the count-limit after this call to obtain silent aborts -- don't
	do it!).  */
