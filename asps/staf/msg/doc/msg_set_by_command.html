<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_Set_By_Command( COM )</h3>


*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) COM !Command-string describing features to be set.

*  Brief description:  ASCII-string command interface to control MSG.

*  Description:
*	Set the MSG package parameters on individual messages, referenced
*	by prefix, according to arguments contained in a single character-
*	string command contained in COM.  Commands take these forms:

*	To disable specific messages, but to continue counting their occurances:
*	DISABLE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

*	To enable specific messages:
*	ENABLE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

*	To resume counting of message occurances, whether or not disabled:
*	COUNT prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

*	To stop counting of message occurances, whether or not disabled:
*	NOCOUNT prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

*	To set message-limits on specific messages:
*	LIMIT prefix-1=limit-1 prefix-2=limit-2 ... prefix-n=limit-n

*	To set message-abort-limits on specific messages:
*	ABORT prefix-1=limit-1 prefix-2=limit-2 ... prefix-n=limit-n

*	To set the number of lines per page in the summary-output:
*	LINES line-count

*	To have time-stamps occur on a changed CPU time (in addition to
*	getting them on changed real-time or node-name):
*	TIMESTAMP CPU

*	To have time-stamps not occur on a changed CPU time (ie, only
*	getting them on changed real-time or node-name):
*	TIMESTAMP NOCPU

*	Spacing is not critical in the command line, provided at least one
*	or more spaces, tabs or commas separate the arguments.
*	The "=" symbols in the LIMIT command are essential, but spaces around
*	it are optional and not at all critical.

*	Wildcards are permitted in the prefix specifications.
