<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_Time_Stamp( LUN )</h3>

	INTEGER LUN

*  Inputs:
*	LUN -- FORTRAN logical unit number for time-stamp to be written on.

*  Outputs: none

*  Brief description:  Write a node and time (real and CPU) stamp to a FORTRAN LUN, if new.

*  Description:
*	"Stamp" the date and time on a line on FORTRAN logical unit LUN.
*	"Stamp" the node-name on the same line, if node-name has been specified
*	with a "call msg_name_node(<node_name>)".
*	Also stamps an elapsed real-time counter and an elapsed CPU-time counter,
*	as 17-character ASCII strings.

*	Produces output only if different than the previous output from
*	this subroutine.  eg, a call to this routine in a tight loop will
*	only produce an actual time-stamp once each second.
