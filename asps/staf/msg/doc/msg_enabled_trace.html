<pre><h3>LOGICAL FUNCTION		MSG_Enabled_Trace( PREFIX, ID )</h3>


*	This routine is obviated by the introduction of classes,
*	but is retained for back-compatibility.

*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) PREFIX !A STAR-standard message prefix.

*  Input/Output:
	INTEGER ID     !STAR-standard message ID.  Set to zero by caller 
                       !before first call, set on first call by
                       !looking up or entering the prefix contained in MSG
                       !(prefix is everything before the first space) in
	               !the index of STAR-standard message prefixes.
	               !If ID is negative, ID remains unchanged, and lookup
	               !is then always by prefix.

*  Outputs: none

*  Brief description:  Return enabled-status for a prefix;  define new prefix "disabled".

*  Description:
*	Returns the message-enabled-status for the STAR-standard message with
*	stored prefix PREFIX, message-index ID.  If the message is not
*	defined, it is defined, but not enabled nor does it count, until
*	explicitly requested.
*	Identical to MSG_ENABLED, except that if a message is defined here,
*	it is defined to be inactive and non-counting, regardless of whether
*	"enable *" (enable all) has been set.  "Trace" messages must be
*	specifically enabled.
*	This is intended to be used with trace messages, which normally
*	reside in code, but are intended to be inactive until explicitly
*	activated to trace the flow of the code, as in debugging.

*   Return conditions:
*	.TRUE. if the message is enabled (active),
*	.FALSE. if the message is disabled (inactive).
