<h2>Messages</h2>

Messages consist of one or more lines of ASCII characters with no more 
that 132 characters per line.  The messages may be completely described in 
FORTRAN DATA or PARAMETER statements, or the C equivalent, or they may be 
generated in real time using FORTRAN "internal files" (ie, character 
strings instead of logical unit numbers), or the C equivalent.  Messages 
may not be generated in any way which directly produces output, such as 
with a FORTRAN WRITE to a logical unit, but only as character strings 
which are then passed as arguments to actual I/O routines (ie, the 
routines in the msg package).  FORTRAN WRITE statements, to "internal 
files" (ie, character strings instead of LUNs), are generally used for 
the purpose of generating the messages to be displayed.  Multiple lines 
are implemented as multiple-dimensioning of the character string used 
to contain the message, eg: 

<pre>
	CHARACTER*132 M132    !Defines a one-line message space.

	CHARACTER*132 M132(6) !Defines a six-line message space.
</pre>

FORTRAN formatted WRITE statements start writing to the next "line" in 
such a character string whenever the new record character "/" is 
encountered.
