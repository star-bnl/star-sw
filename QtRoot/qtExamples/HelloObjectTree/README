TQtObjectViewFrame is a subclass of QTreeView widget.
(see: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtreeview.html )
The class objects emits

   Activated(TObject*) 

Qt signal. That can be used to incorporate the widget into the more complex 
GUI application.

The widget can be used with the Qt designer by promoting the Qt4 QTreeView
class (see:http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/designer-using-custom-widgets.html#promoting-widgets )

To  build the and run the test application do

   1. "Un-tar" the archive
       tar -xzvf HelloObjectTree.tar.gz

   2  Invoke:
      qmake
      make

   3. Usage:
      Usage: HelloObjectTree [-h | [ [-style=[windows | platinum | cgi | kde ] | [myRootfile.root]]

        The application creates an instance of the widget and populates it with
        the objects read from the ROOT file . It pops up the "Open File Dialog" as
        needed
        (see:http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qfiledialog.html#getOpenFileName )

    One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
    The number of the available different styles is defined by 
    your local Qt installation.

    You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
