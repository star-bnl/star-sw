To  build it from the Qt project file do

   1.> qmake
   2.> make  (or "nmake"  on Windows, no cygwin !!! )

To start the application do:
            
   3.  "CustomWidgets  [-style=windows | platinum | motif ]"
      
     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.

     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility

     See: "http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qapplication.html#QApplication"
     for details and other command mode parameters.

   4. Try to change the design of the widget via qt "designer"
     (see: http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/pictures/QtROOTCustomWidgets.png )
     
      > designer CustomWidgets.pro
      > qmake
      > make
