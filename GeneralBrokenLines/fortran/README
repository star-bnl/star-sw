Track refitting with broken lines in 3D building on:

A new fast track-fit algorithm based on broken lines
V. Blobel, NIM A, 566 (2006), pp. 14-17

===========================================================

For a track with an initial trajectory from a prefit of the
measurements (internal seed) or an external prediction
(external seed) the description of multiple scattering is 
added by offsets in a local system. Along the initial
trajectory points are defined with can describe a measurement
or a (thin) scatterer or both. Measurements are arbitrary
functions of the local track parameters at a point (e.g. 2D:
position, 4D: slope+position). The refit provides corrections
to the local track parameters (in the local system) and the
corresponding covariance matrix at any of those points.
Outliers can be down-weighted by use of M-estimators.

The broken lines trajectory is defined by (2D) offsets at the 
first and last point and all points with a scatterer. The
prediction for a measurement is obtained by interpolation of
the enclosing offsets and for triplets of adjacent offsets
kink angles are determined. This requires for all points the
jacobians for propagation to the previous and next offset.
These are calculated from the point-to-point jacobians along
the initial trajectory.

Additional local or global parameters can be added and the
trajectories can be written to special binary files for
calibration and alignment with Millepede-II.

The conventions for the coordinate systems follow:
