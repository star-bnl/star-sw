Class defining the pair production occured at passing the

All energies are assumed in eV.
But it seems that it is not strict requirement.
If to change this in file "file_name" and in interface,
the energies could be in any units.

     If w is encreased by n times (with the same form of distribution, 
     that is equivalent to the shift of distribution, 
     the dispersion is changed as 1/n^2 D_old.
     If the resulting energy is multiplied by k, that is the proportional
     extension of the distribution, the relative dispersion is not changed.
     The relative dispersion is (<N^2> - <N>^2)/N.
     If to add the onbvious change of the mean energy occured with
     the change of these parameters,
     it is possible to obtain the formulae for conversion.
