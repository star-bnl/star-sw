      constructed in SVT ...

       This will require some disentanglement of the SVT code to get right 
       requires an SVT structure to be manipulated, instead of the SCON strut 
       Can I set this up within the SVT config? 

       Yes.  Typically there is 1:1 correspondance between geometry tag and
       an SCON flag.  2008 breaks this for the first cut geometry.  (We can
       change that geometry tag and not hurt anything).
