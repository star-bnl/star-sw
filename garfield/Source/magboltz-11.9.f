C---------------------------------------------------------------------
C  VERSION 6: REMOVED ALL RESTRICTIONS ON ANGULAR SCATTERING , ALL 
C   ELASTIC AND INELASTIC SCATTERING PROCESSES CAN NOW HAVE ANGULAR
C   DISTRIBUTIONS ( IF INCLUDED IN DATA BASE)
C   IF THE ELASTIC ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION EXISTS THEN PROGRAM USES THIS AS
C  AN APPROXIMATION TO THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRIMARY 
C  IONISATION ELECTRON ( SECONDARIES ALWAYS HAVE ISOTROPIC SCATTERING). 
C  THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRIMARY IS TAKEN TO BE THE SAME AS   
C  THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF AN ELASTIC SCATTERED ELECTRON WITH THE
C  SAME FINAL ENERGY.  
C  THIS ALGORITHM FOR THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRIMARY IONISATION
C  ELECTRON REPRODUCES EXPERIMENTAL IONISATION ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS
C  AND ALSO GIVES THE CORRECT RANGES FOR HIGH ENERGY ELECTRONS          
C  IN GASES . RANGES ARE ACCURATE UP TO 100KEV.
C  N.B  IF USING WATER MIXTURES YOU WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN COMPUTING
C       TIME COMPARED TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS SINCE NOW 210 ROTATIONAL 
C       TRANSITIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DATA BASE. 
C---------------------------------------------------------------------
C  CALCULATES DRIFT,DIFFUSION,GAIN AND ATTACHMENT OF ELECTRONS IN 
C  GASES WITH APPLIED ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AT ARBITRARY ANGLES.
C  THE COMMON BLOCK STRUCTURE OF THE RESULTS IS OUTLINED BELOW.
C  PLEASE QUOTE THE DATA BASE REVISION YEAR FOR THE GAS USED IN THE DATA
C  BASE, ( E.G. KRYPTON (2002) ) , IN ANY PUBLICATIONS.        
C ---------------------------------------------------------------------
C  LINUX PC VERSION USES DRAND48 DOUBLE PRECISION RANDOM NO GENERATOR
C  (CAN ALSO USE RNDM2 FROM CERNLIB WITH THE SAME PRECISION ). 
C  --------------------------------------------------------------------
C  THE PROGRAM ALLOWS ANISOTROPIC ELASTIC AND INELASTIC SCATTERING :
C    REF : NIM A 421 (1999) 234-240  
C   THE GAS DATA BASE LIST BELOW SHOWS THOSE X-SECTIONS WHICH CONTAIN 
C   ANISOTROPIC SCATTERING DATA. 
C   POSTSCRIPT PLOTS OF THE DATABASE X-SECTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED ON:-
C    HTTP://CONSULT.CERN.CH/WRITEUPS/MAGBOLTZ/CROSS/
C---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
C  THIS VERSION ALLOWS SPATIAL GRADIENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SOLUTION 
C  FOR THE TOWNSEND GAIN AND ATTACHMENT COEFICIENTS. 
C   THE PROGRAM AUTOMATICALLY GIVES A SOLUTION WITH SPATIAL GRADIENTS  
C  FOR BOTH TIME OF FLIGHT (TOF), PULSED TOWNSEND (PT) AND STEADY STATE 
C   TOWNSEND (SST) PARAMETERS. 
C  THE NOMENCLATURE IS SIMILAR TO SAKAI ET AL. J.PHYS.D10 (1977) 1035.
C  THE SIMULATION OF AVALANCHE GAIN DETECTORS AT HIGH FIELD REQUIRES THE
C  USE OF SST TOWNSEND PARAMETERS.     
C  THE PROGRAM AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES THE COMMON BLOCKS /CTOWNS/ AND
C   /CTWNER/ WITH THE SST PARAMETERS IF THE SPATIAL GRADIENTS ARE 
C   GREATER THAN :  ABS (ALPHA-ATT)  = 30/CM AT NTP.  
C   WHERE ABS= MAGNITUDE , ALPHA=GAIN COEFICIENT AND ATT=ATTACHMENT.
C  ( FOR SMALLER VALUES OF ABS(ALPHA-ATT) < 30/CM , THE CHANGE OF THE
C  GAIN OR ATTACHMENT IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN 3% FOR THE SOLUTION WITHOUT
C   SPATIAL GRADIENTS ). 
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C --------------------------------------------------------------------
C THE  INPUT CONTROL FLAG IPEN WHEN SET TO 1 ALLOWS SOME PENNING CALCS:
C  
C   ESTIMATES OF THE PENNING EFFECT AT HIGH FIELD CAN BE OBTAINED BY 
C  EDITING THE ARRAY PENFRA(3,235) IN THE GAS DATA BASE SUBROUTINES.
C THE PROGRAM CAN THEN BE RECOMPILED AND RUN. THE OUTPUT THEN CONTAINS
C INFORMATION ON THE PENNING FRACTION USED IN THE CALCULATION.
C  IN THE GAS MIXTURES. PENNING EFFECTS CAN OCCUR BETWEEN EXCITED STATES
C   IN THE GAS MIXTURE WHICH ARE HIGHER IN ENERGY THAN THE LOWEST 
C    IONISATION POTENTIAL IN THE MIXTURE.
C  THE FIRST ENTRY PENFRA(1,N) IS THE FRACTION OF THE EXCITED STATE N
C  THAT WILL TRANSFER TO IONISE THE LOWER IONISATION LEVELS IN THE GAS
C  MIXTURE. 
C   THE SECOND ENTRY ,PENFRA(2,N) IS THE DELOCALISATION LENGTH OF THE
C  TRANSFER I.E. THE AVERAGE DISTANCE THAT THE EXCITED GAS WILL TRAVEL
C  BEFORE THE TRANSFER ( OR IN CASE OF PHOTON EMISSION AND CAPTURE)
C  THE AVERAGE DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY THE PHOTON)
C  THE THIRD ENTRY , PENFRA(3,N) IS THE DECAY TIME OF THE EXCITED STATE
C  IN THE MIXTURE.
C  NB DELOCALISATION DISTANCE IS IN MICRONS AND DECAY TIME IN PICOSECS.
C   THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC METHOD FOR CHOOSING THE PENNING FRACTION BUT 
C  YOU WILL FIND THAT THE ARRAY PENFRA(1,250) FOR HELIUM HAS BEEN SET TO 
C  1.0 (100%) THIS IS THE ONLY CORRECT CHOICE FOR THIS GAS WITH ANY OTHER
C  GAS MIXED IN. SIMILARLY THE NEON PENNING FRACTION SHOULD BE BETWEEN
C  0.3 AND 0.7 (30 TO 70 %) . ARGON WHEN MIXED WITH HYDROCARBONS OTHER
C THAN METHANE GIVES PENNING FRACTIONS OF 0 TO 30%.   
C   IF DIFFICULTY OCCURS CONTACT THE AUTHOR.
C 
C ********************************************************************* 
C  THE PROGRAM SHOULD ALWAYS CONVERGE TO A SOLUTION. THE ERROR ON THE 
C  INTEGRATION SHOULD SCALE WITH THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE NUMBER OF 
C  COLLISIONS (PARAMETER NMAX) . THE OUTPUT SHOULD ALWAYS BE CHECKED TO
C  ENSURE THAT THE NUMBER OF COLLISIONS IN THE LAST ENERGY BIN IS SMALL,
C  ANY VALUE LESS THAN  500 SHOULD GIVE REASONABLE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
C   IF THE NUMBER OF COLLISIONS IS GREATER THAN 500 THEN THE INTEGRATION
C   ENERGY RANGE SHOULD BE INCREASED.  
C***********************************************************************
C  THE PROGRAM IS LIMITED IN PRECISION BY THE STATISTICAL ACCURACY
C  OF THE RESULTS. IT IS POSSIBLE  TO OBTAIN A STATISTICAL ACCURACY 
C  OF BETTER THAN 0.1% ON THE DRIFT VELOCITY AND 1% ON THE
C  DIFFUSION COEFICIENTS IN MOST COUNTING GAS MIXTURES IN ABOUT    
C  1 MINUTE OF COMPUTING TIME ON A PC , ALPHA OR WORKSTATION.
C  AT HIGH FIELD WHEN THE TOWNSEND COEFICIENT IS INCLUDED IN THE SPATIAL
C  GRADIENT THE COMPUTATION TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE TO A FEW 
C   MINUTES.     
C  WHEN VELOCITY VECTORS ARE SMALL SUCH AS THE CASE WITH SMALL LORENTZ
C  ANGLES THE PARAMETER NMAX WILL NEED TO BE INCREASED TO 20  OR MORE.  
C

C 2015: UPDATE INCLUDES NEW OSCILATOR STRENGTH TO EXCITATIONS WHICH
C       ARE ALL DISSOCIATIVE. INTRODUCED ALL DISSOCIATIVE IONISATION 
C       CHANNELS FROM THE 3 GROUPS:  LINDSAY , NISHIMURA AND BONHAM
C       USED WEIGHTED AVERAGE TO GET CONSISTENT COUNTING AND GROSS 
C       IONISATIONS.
C 
C 2012: UPDATE INCLUDES CARBON AND FLUORINE K-SHELL IONISATION X-SECS.     
C   NEW ANALYSIS UPDATED TO MARCH  2008
C   ALLOWS SUPERELASTIC SCATTERING TO V2,V4,V1 AND V3 VIBRATIONAL LEVELS
C   BORN ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION FOR  V4 AND V3 VIBRATIONAL LEVELS
C   INCLUDED NEW IONISATION X-SECTIONS BY NISHIMURA AND READJUSTED
C   DISSOCIATION X-SECTION TO FIT TOWNSEND MEASUREMENTS.
C   ELASTIC X-SECTION BELOW 0.6 EV ASSUMED ISOTROPIC SINCE NO ACCURATE 
C   DATA EXIST ON ELASTIC SCATTERING AT THE RAMSAUER MINIMUM.
C   THE ELASTIC X-SECTION BETWEEN 0.0 AND 0.6 EV IS NOT SENSITIVE
C   ENOUGH TO DRIFT AND DIFFUSION TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE 
C   POSITION OF THE RAMSAUER MINIMUM. THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE ELASTIC
C   X-SECTION BELOW THE RAMSAUER MINIMUM ( LESS THAN 0.18 EV) SEEMS TO 
C   BE LOWER THAN PREDICTIONS BY MANN AND LINDER OR FIELD ET AL.  
C    THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE LOW FIELD MOBILITY CF GEE AND 
C   FREEMAN WHICH IS REPRODUCED BY THIS X-SECTION SET SEEMS ALSO TO 
C   EXCLUDE HIGHER ELASTIC X-SECTIONS IN THE REGION BETWEEN 0.02 AND 
C   0.1 EV.
C   THE DATA BASE NOW FITS NAKAMURAS DRIFT VELOCITY IN CF4 AND CF4 ARGON
C   MIXTURES TO WITHIN EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS . NAKAMURAS DATA IS MUCH MORE 
C   ACCURATE THAN HUNTERS DATA SO WE REJECT HUNTERS DATA IN THE NEW 
C   ANALYSIS.
C   THE TOWNSEND IONISATION AND ATTACHMENT RATES AGREE WELL WITH THE 
C   PUBLISHED DATA .

C 2014 UPDATE INCLUDES CORRECT OSCILLATOR STRENGTH AND FIT TO NEW 
C       TOWNSEND DATA
C 2012 UPDATE INCLUDES K-SHELL IONISATION
C 2009 UPDATE OF 1999 SUBROUTINE
C      VERSION INCLUDES ANISOTROPIC SCATTERING. USED ISOTROPIC ELASTIC
C      SCATTERING BELOW 2 EV DUE TO LACK OF EXPERIMENTAL ELECTRON 
C      SCATTERING DATA.
C      ALSO INCLUDES BETTER TREATMENT OF TORSIONAL EXCITATION (USED A 
C      2-LEVEL APPROXIMATION FOR TORSION)
C      IMPROVED FANO FACTOR AND W FROM BETTER EXCITATION/DISSOCIATION
C      X-SECTIONS . PUBLISHED ELECTRON SCATTERING DATA UP TO 2009 IS
C      INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS. GOOD FIT +-1% TO SCHMIDTS HE/ISO DATA .
C      SCHMIDT AND MARTENS : HEIDELBERG PREPRINT :HD-PY 92/02
C      STILL SOME PROBLEMS WITH AR/ISO FITS +-2% BUT PROBABLY CAUSED
C      BY POOR QUALITY EXPERIMENTAL DRIFT VELOCITY DATA.
C      E.G. NO CONSISTANCY AT 3% LEVEL BETWEEN : 
C      FUJII ET AL:  NIM A245(1986)35
C      AND BECKER : HTTP://CYCLO.MIT.EDU/DRIFT/WWW
