To run the standard way: 
 Use  $STAR/kumacs/sim/run_gstar_g2t.kumac or
              /chain/call_bfc_gstar_g2t 
         -> uses geometry & physics setups specified in
               $STAR/pams/geometry/geometry/geometry.g
         which one can't change (have to ask Pavel).


To run the way where you get more control:
  Use $STAR/kumacs/sim/run_gstar_g2t_full.kumac
        -> uses geometry & physics setups specified in
              $STAR/kumacs/sim/set_phys_hadronic_on.kumac
                               set_phys_hadronic_off.kumac
                               load_star_geometry.kumac
           You can pull these kumacs to your area and
           change them if you want to - easier to create
           a non-standard way of running (but you must be
           careful!!)
