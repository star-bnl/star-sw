 * \description:
 *  class defining geometrical aspects of an EPD Tile
 *  (position of center, RandomPointOnTile(), etc.)
 *
 * The user may pass the PP/TT/EW _or_ the uniqueID to
 *   most functions.  No option to pass StEpdHit object,
 *   because we want to avoid StObject-dependence.
 *   Instead, simply use StEpdHit::id(),
 *   e.g. RandomPointOnTile(hit->id())
