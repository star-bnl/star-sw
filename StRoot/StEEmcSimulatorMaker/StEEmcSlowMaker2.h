 * \section VERSION_1_0 versions 1.0 to 1.4
 *
 * StEEmcSlowMaker is the slow simulator for the EEMC.  At present,
 * it adds poisson statistics to the simulated response of the
 * SMD, pre- and postshower detector chain.  It is also capable of
 * adding realistic pedestal offsets (and widths) based on database
 * information.
 * 
 * Geant energy deposit was converted to an ADC response by the
 * StEEmcFastMaker.  This is inverted using gains stored with the 
 * "sim" flavor in the database, and thre resulting energy deposit
 * is converted to number of mips.  This is converted to the mean
 * number of photoelectrons produced based on QA measurements at
 * ANL (currently a fixed mean of 2.0 pe per mip for SMD, and 
 * 3.9 pe per mip pre/post).  Poisson statistics are applied, and
 * the results smeared with the single pe resolution.
 *
 * Physics parameters are configurable through various "set" methods
 * below.  Defaults should be good for most applications.
 *
 * By default, the ADC values stored in the muDst are overwritten
 * with the values computed in this maker.  i.e. makers in the chain
 * which follow this maker will see more realistic SMD and pre/postshower
 * response than those which come before it in the chain... i.e. unless
 * you know what you're doing, put this before your anlaysis maker!
 *
 * Present status: work ongoing to add more realistic light yield, 1 p.e. 
 * resolution, etc.
 *
 * For the time being, towers remain a straight energy deposit --> adc
 * coversion.  See StEEmcFastMaker.
 *
 * \section VERSION_2_0 version 2.0
 *
 * Starting with version 2.0, improvements have been made to the
 * EEMC simulation:
 *
 * -# A fix has been applied which masks out towers whenever a "fail" bit is set in the database.  Previously this would only take effect if pedestal offsets were added to the tower.
 * -# Pre/post and SMD simulation now use StEmcHit::energy() and StMuEmcHit::getEnergy() to access energy deposited in tiles/strips.
 * -# Corrections to the tower ADC values based on the energy deposited in the pre- and postshower layers are now made.  See below for discussion.
 *
 * The pre- and postshower layers of the endcap differ in construction 
 * from the other layers in the calorimeter stack.  Two wavelength shifting
 * fibers are used to collect the light in each of these layers, routed
 * to the PMT tubes for the tower containing the pre/postshower tile, 
 * and to seperate MAPMT tubes for the preshower and postshower readouts.
 * To correct for nonlinearities introduced by this construction, the
 * preshower layers are 5mm thick (as opposed to 4mm for layers 3-24)
 * and made of brighter scintillator.  
 *
 * The difference in geometry is accounted for in the geant model, but 
 * the brightness difference is not.  Measurements of the mean number
 * photoelectrons per MIP (<npe>/MIP) show that the preshower layers
 * yield 1.86 times as much light per MIP compared to layers 3-23.
 * The postshower layer yields only 0.94 times as much light as layers
 * 3-23.
 *
 * The fast simulator simulates the tower response in the following way.
 * First it sums the GEANT energy deposited in the scintillator in all 24 
 * layers 
 *
 * E = E_pre1 + E_pre2 + E_layer3 + ... + E_layer23 + E_post
 *
 * It then divides by the sampling fraction and multiplies by the ideal
 * gain to obtain the ADC response of the tower.  The ideal gain is set
 * such that a ET=60 GeV photon corresponds to ADC=4096.
 *
 * ADC = E * gain / sampling fraction = E * gain / 0.048
 *
 * But because the preshower (postshower) layers yield more (less)
 * light per unit energy deposit, they are under (over) represented
 * in the energy sum, and thus the ADC response.
 *
 * To correct for this, the slow simulator calculated a "light yield
 * weighted energy deposit"
 *
 * E' = f * E_pre1 + g * E_pre2 + ... + h * E_post
 *
 * with weights f,g,h for the preshower-1, preshower-2 and postshower
 * layers.  Substituting in the energy deposited in all layers, we 
 * can write E' as
 *
 * E' = E + (f-1) * E_pre1 + (g-1) * E_pre2 + (h-1) * E_post
 *
 * where f = g = 1.68 * (4/5), and h = 0.94 * (4/5) are the measured relative 
 * <npe>/MIP for 4mm of preshower 1, preshower 2 and postshower, 
 * relative to the <npe>/MIP for layers 3-23.  The factors of (4/5) are 
 * present because the measured ratios include the increase in brightness
 * due to the increased thickness of pre1,pre2 and post.  This increase
 * is already accounted for by the GEANT model, and hence should be 
 * factored out of the brightness correction.
 *
 * \section VERSION_2_10 version 2.10
 *
 * -# A flag was added to set specific defaults for use in BFC production.
 * -# Default behavior in MuDst analysis chain was changed to _disable_ the tower
 * slow simulator since slow simulator will be run in BFC and energy deposits
 * are not stored in the MuDst for towers.  It is possible to 'redo' the slow
 * simulator in an analysis chain using the event.root files from the simulation
 * -# Pedestal smearing is truncated at N sigma (default is N=3)
 * -# Set thicknesses of pre-shower layers to 4.75 to match fixed geometry
 *
 * Minor code cleanups...
