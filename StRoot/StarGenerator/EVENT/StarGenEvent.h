   \class StarGenEvent
   \brief Base class for event records

   StarGenEvent is the base class for event records in the STAR framework.
   Concrete event generators will generally use one of the derived classes
   which represent pp, ep, AA, or eA collisions:
   \li StarGenPPEvent
   \li StarGenEPEvent
   \li StarGenAAEvent
   \li StarGenEAEvent

   The base class contains common functionality across all typical event 
   generators in STAR:
   \li List of generated particles
   \li Collision geometry (energy, beams)
   \li Event number, run number
   \li Daq file number (for embedding jobs)
   \li Generator ID and process ID in the generator

   Derived classes save additional information revelant to the kinematics of
   the system being studied, such as (in a pp collision)...
   \li x1, x2 of the interacting partons
   \li id of the interacting partons
   \li value of the PDFs at the x1 and x2 of the hard interaction
   \li etc...

   StarGenEvent, and its derived classes, are intended to allow the developer to
   provide a persistent record of the state of an event generator on each event.
   It provides a record of the primary particles generated, and a record of the
   final state particles which are pushed to the GEANT stack for simulation.
   
   \section Description

   The particle record is based on the HEPEVT and HepMC standards.  Generated 
   particles are created as instances of the StarGenParticle class and added
   to a list of particles.  The mother-daughter relationships of these particles
   is encoded as integers which refer to the index of the mother (daughter) 
   particle within the list.  Developers should take care in implementing their
   event generators to make sure that the status-code conventions defined in
   StarGenParticle are understood and respected.  The decision whether a particle
   is stable and should be stacked out for geant simulationn is handled by the
   framework... but it is based on that convention.

   The particle record maintains two lists of particles.  The complete event 
   record, listing all particles which have been generated, and
   the list of particles which have been stacked out to the geant simulation.
   It is the responsability of the developer to fill in the full list
   of particles.  The framework will take care of the decision of whether
   to stack the particle out and fill in the reference list of particles
   whcih have been fully simulated.
   
   Header inforamtion is kept simple, as different event generators will have 
   a different set of variables which a developer will want to be filled.  So
   here we provide only the event number, run number, generator and process ID.
   Additional variables to store kinematic information are implemented in the 
   derived classes.

   \section Usage

   StarPrimaryMaker is setup to save the event record in a TTree.  The primary maker
   aggregates the particles generated by all event generators in the chain, adding
   them to an instance of StarGenEvent.
