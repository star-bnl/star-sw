   \brief Main steering class for event generation

   StarPrimaryMaker is the main steering maker for event generators in the (new) STAR
   event generator framework.  Users add one or more event generators (derived from
   StarGenerator) to the maker.  The primary maker is responsible for calling the 
   event generators in a well-defined calling sequence:

   1) PreGenerate Phase

   During the PreGenerate phase, the PreGenerate() method will be called on all generators
   in the order in which they were added to the primary maker.  This (optional) method on
   event generators is provided for the developer to perform any event-by-event configuration
   which may be required by the event generator.

   2) Generate Phase

   During the Generate phase, the event generation machinery of the concrete event generator
   is called.  Generate will be called on all event generators, in the order in which they
   were added to the primary maker.  Generate will be called on all generatos before the 
   PostGenerate phase is entered.  At the end of Generate, it is expected that event generators
   have filled their event records.

   3) PostGenerate Phase

   After Generate has been called on all generators, PostGenerate will be called on each 
   generator in the order in which they were added to the primary maker.  Developers may
   at this point access the results from event generators which were found earlier in the
   chain.  This is the last point at which a developer may interact with the event record.

   After PostGenerate, the event is finalized.  The primary maker will loop over all event
   generators in its list, set the vertex, and accumulate the particles from each generator
   at an appropriate vertex.  Two modes are available on generators:  standard and pileup 
   mode.  Standard mode (which is the default) places all events at the same vertex.  
   Pileup mode places pileup events, with some probability, at an independent vertex.

   Event Record

   The event record, which records the particle-wise and event-wise inforamtion from each
   event generator, is saved in a TTree format.  The results from each generator are saved
   in a separate branch, whose name corresponds to the assigned name of the generator.

   Particle-wise information is stored as an array of StarGenParticle s.  The main event
   record lists all particles which were generated, with inices refering to their position
   in their parent event generator, their position in the event record of the main event 
   generator, and their position on the GEANT stack (aka ID truth).


   Event Vertex

   The event-vertex is generated by StarPrimaryMaker.  It is sampled from a gaussian distributions
   in x, y and z.  The possibility exists to correlate the x and y distributions.  See SetSigma()
   for details.


   Beamline Constraint

   The beamline as measured at STAR may be simulated.  For the case where an SDT timestamp is 
   specified, the user may set the attribute "beamline" to true

      primary->SetAttr("beamline", 1)

   This will instruct the StarPrimaryMaker to lookup the beamline constraint as recorded
   in the online database for the requested SDT timestamp.  Otherwise, the beamline may
   be specified by hand by calling

      primary->SetSlope( dxdz, dydz );

   When setting the beamline by hand, you should *not* use SetAttr("beamline",1).  That will
   cause the maker to attempt to load slopes from the database, resulting in no slope.
