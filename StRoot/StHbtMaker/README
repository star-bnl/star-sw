26jul99 - MALisa - StHbtMaker works now in dev/
	- do NOT have to do any fancy stuff with MakeDll

From README of Randy Wells' CoulombCorrection:

correctionpp.dat -and- correctionpm.dat have the following form:
Presently, I have added one data line to the bottom.(see below)

1st line:
        A list of the radii that we have Coulomb corrections 
        calculated for r1,r2,r3,r4,...

Rest:
        A table of eta's and the Coulomb corrections
        First column is eta
        Rest are the corrections of the respective radius from first line.

        eta1  Coul(eta1,r1)  Coul(eta1,r2)  Coul(eta1,r3)  ...
        eta2  Coul(eta2,r1)  Coul(eta2,r2)  Coul(eta2,r3)  ...
        ...
        ...
        ...

These files were created in ~rcwells/root/coulomb/  using various little
programs to rewrite data files.  SEE the README.txt in that directory.
