/******
*
*     Header defining crate configuration numbers
*
*     J.M. Nelson        November 2008
*
*     JMN 04Oct16  All ConfNum are defined in trgConfig.h
*                  A separate file is not needed as duplication is bad
*     JMN 29Aug17  In order to keep RTS/trg/include in step with $DEV
*                  re-place ConfNum from trgConfig.h to this file and
*                  #include trgConfnum.h in trgConfig.h
*     JMN 15Jul22  Added CLK_CONF_NUM 17 at request from CWP
*     JMN 02Aug22  Changed sequence to include EQ4 and leave a gap at 18
*                  for the next crate.  EXT_CONF_NUM will be an offset/
*                  length pair for a new set of headers.
