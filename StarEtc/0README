1. star.rootrc rootrc file for ROOT.60.24.00. To run ROOT must do copy:
   cp 601600.rootrc ~/.rootrc 

2. rootlogon.C ROOT logon which is called on init

3. STAR.h include file with the set of popular STAR includes  used in macros.
   for instance in bfc.C

4 source skip_dirs.csh
  An example how to skip compilation of non desirable directories


5 source rstarroot.csh

6. agmlupd.csh acro to compile & update AGML stuff.

Unfortunatelly in cons still existing soe bugs. As a result some dependency
